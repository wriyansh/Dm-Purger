# Discord Selfbot DM Purger

This is a Discord selfbot script written in Python using the `discord.py-self` library. The bot allows you to clear direct messages (DMs) with users or group DMs, with the option to set a custom delay between message deletions.

## Features
- **Clear all DMs:** Purge messages in all your DMs with other users or group DMs.
- **Clear a specific DM:** Choose a specific DM or group DM to purge.
- **Custom Delay:** Set a custom delay (in seconds) between message deletions to prevent rate-limiting issues.

## Requirements

To run this bot, you need the following Python libraries:

- `discord.py` (for interacting with the Discord API)
- `colorama` (for colored terminal output)

Install the dependencies with:

pip install -r requirements.txt
